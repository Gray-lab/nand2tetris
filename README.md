# nand2tetris

Desiring to learn more about how computers and programming works under the hood, I decided to work through the excellent nand2tetris course by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. 
This repository contains all the nand2tetris files as well as all the code I wrote while completing the class.

The course content can all be found [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course).
