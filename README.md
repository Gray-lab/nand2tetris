# nand2tetris

Desiring to learn more about how computers and programming languages work under the hood, I decided to work through the excellent nand2tetris course by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. 

I particularly enjoyed coding the Assembler (project 6), the VM (maybe more accurately a compiler back-end) (project 7 & 8), and the compiler (project 10 & 11). I also enjoyed the challenge of writing a snake game in Jack, which I did in project 9. The assembler, VM, and compiler are all written in Python, and represent the first larger pieces of software that I wrote from scratch. While nand2tetris does provide a rough api suggestion in the different project, no starter code is provided, and the api is more focused towards a strongly OOP language like Java. I really enjoyed this challenge, even if looking at the code now makes me feel like so much could be improved. 

If you are working through the class yourself, I recommend that you finish the projects yourself before seeing my solutions, as otherwise you may miss out on some of the wonder that comes from really understanding the process.
