# nand2tetris

Desiring to learn more about how computers and programming works under the hood, I decided to work through the excellent nand2tetris course by Shimon Schocken and Noam Nisan. 
This repository contains all the nand2tetris files as well as all the code I wrote while completing the class. If you are working through the class yourself, I recommend that you finish the projects yourself before seeing my solutions, as otherwise you may miss out on some of the wonder that comes from really understanding the process.

The course content can all be found [here](https://www.nand2tetris.org/course).
